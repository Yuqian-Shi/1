# Turtle-shell program
# fill the picture with given pattern
# Authorï¼š Yuqian Shi
# ====================================
# Approach:
# All pixels can be divided into three groups: background, line and cross points.
# The cross points (point) were separated into two types: A and B, depending on
# which side the horizontal line is.
# Each point should have three lines connected to it and
# each line consists three pixels (except the cross point).
# Maintain a list of undraw-points-list
# And the other end points of the three lines could be added to undraw-points-list.
# After drawing a point from the undraw-points-list (list), remove it.
# Repeat until the list is empty.
# If the required picture is too small in width or height,
# first generate a larger picture and then cut it smaller.
# ====================================
# 1. Set a initial point at (0,3) and add it to the list.
# 2. Try to draw lines around the point(s) in list.
# 3. Remove the drew point and add new points (drawable) into the list.
# 4. Repeat 3 until the list is empty
